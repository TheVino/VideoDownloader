-	Display your download status

###### Well.. How?
Using pytube package to request the **download** and Custom Tk Inter for a **clean UI**.

See any issues with this? If no, I will tell you: *the thumbnail displayed will be the same size stored on Youtube. Meaning no prediction of what would be the image size when displayed* ðŸ˜…

### Future Features ~~ideas~~:
- Check a way to dynamically update thumbnail size according to window size
- Maybe some better UI ðŸ¤”
